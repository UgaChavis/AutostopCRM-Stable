# AutoStop CRM Project Memory

Use this file for durable notes that should not be rediscovered every session.

## Recurring Themes

- employees module changes need UI, API, and regression coverage together
- payroll actions should be smoke-tested on live UI after deploys
- create mode in employees must keep the selected record separate from new entries
- the employee month/report view can hide or discard state if not guarded carefully
- production verification is not optional after meaningful deployment work
- live UI smoke checks catch issues that unit tests can miss
- server sync is a separate step from local green tests

## Current Known Cautions

- default admin credentials are still a production concern
- browser-run artifacts should not be left in the worktree
- stale branch notes are less reliable than `git rev-parse` output

## When To Add Notes Here

- when a bug repeats
- when a workflow takes more than one session to rediscover
- when a production quirk matters for future debugging
- when a command proves to be the safe default

## Example Note Format

- date
- symptom
- root cause
- fix
- verification
